# Path is relative to the location of the configuration file and specifies
# the root to expand all paths from
# If not set, defaults to a git repository root
#root: 'relative/path/from/configuration/file/directory'

# Path is relative to configuration root and specifies where cached metadata will be stored.
# If not set, defaults to '.licenses'

# Path is relative to configuration root and specifies the working directory when enumerating dependencies

# Dependencies with these licenses are allowed and will not raise errors or warnings.
# This list does not have a default value and is required for `licensed status`
# to succeed.
allowed:
  - mit

  - bsd-3-clause
  - cc0-1.0
  - isc

# These dependencies are ignored during enumeration.
# They will not be cached, and will not raise errors or warnings.
# This configuration is intended to be used for dependencies that don't need to
# be included for compliance purposes, such as other projects owned by the current
# project's owner, internal dependencies, and dependencies that aren't shipped with
# the project like test frameworks.
#ignored:
#  gradle:
#    - some-internal-gem

# These dependencies have licenses not on the `allowed` list and have been reviewed.
# They will be cached and checked, but will not raise errors or warnings for a
# non-allowed license.  Dependencies on this list will still raise errors if
# license text cannot be found for the dependency.

# A single configuration file can be used to enumerate dependencies for multiple

#  - source_path: path/to/application2
